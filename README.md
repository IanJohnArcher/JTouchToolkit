# JTouchToolkit

Welcome to the home for Java Haptics Development

This project is to create a comprehensive haptics API for the Java Language, this project started with the writing of a Java Binding to the SensAble [OpenHaptics API HD/HL](http://www.sensable.com/products-openhaptics-toolkit.htm) by Ian John Archer (Software Engineer - Birmingham City University User-Lab). The first version of the JTouchToolkit was release OpenSource ([GNU General Public License v. 2.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html)) in Sept of 2007 after a year of in house development by User-Lab. The main aim of this project is to create a Haptics API that takes advantage of the benefits of a mature yet growing language such as Java, but other aims include:

- Simplify the development of haptic systems
- To incorporate a number of other devices and other techniques, possible technologies:

	- [SenseGraphics H3D API](http://www.h3dapi.org/) - ([X3D](http://www.web3d.org/))
	- [Novint Falcon](http://home.novint.com/products/novint_falcon.php)
	- A re-usable material library (to prevent the re-writing of algorithms to mimic standard materials)

- Move forward in the understanding of the possible uses of Haptics in Systems

We are interested in building a community with a range of skills, the range of people we are interested in can have skills from developers to researchers and even general observers. Any contribution however small or large will be welcome. The type of skills for example:

- Language experience:
	- Java
	- C/C++
	- JNI (Java Native Interface)
	- [SensAble OpenHaptics API](http://www.sensable.com/products-openhaptics-toolkit.htm)
	- [SensGraphics H3D API](http://www.h3dapi.org/)
